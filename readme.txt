What you need to know to configure on the site:

1) You can upload the site into any folder on your server, but you MUST enter the correct containing url (where the index.html is) to the <base> tag in index.html.

2) Every text on the site is in index.html, no need to change them anywhere else.

3) Always use 1400x1000px pictures as background pictures, otherwise they just don't show up.

4) Set the opacity and the color mask of the background pictures as you please in the <style> tag (0 to 1) in index.html.

5) Modify the main stylesheet as you please in "wp-content/themes/pique/style.css". The classes are used on index.html tags.

6) Upload any font face to "wp-content/themes/pique/fonts/", but you need to use .eot, .ttf, .otf, .woff extensions (all of them) for the different browser recognition. Make sure you have defined the @font-face in style.css.
